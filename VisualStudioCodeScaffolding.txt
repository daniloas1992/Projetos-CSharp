Controller:
https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/tutorials/first-mvc-app/adding-model?view=aspnetcore-5.0&tabs=visual-studio-code


To scaffolder a controller, we need to use the command below:
dotnet aspnet-codegenerator controller -name BooksController --relativeFolderPath Controllers --useDefaultLayout --referenceScriptLibraries --readWriteActions

To scaffolder a view, the command is like below:
dotnet aspnet-codegenerator view Index List -m Book -outDir Views\Books --useDefaultLayout --referenceScriptLibraries

If you saw errors like “Could not execute because the specified command or file was not found.” during the first time you execute the command, remember you need to install aspnet-codegenerator to run the command successfully.
dotnet tool install -g dotnet-aspnet-codegenerator

Besides that, you need to add scaffolding packages to your project too. Below are some packages need to add, and it depends on your project components.
dotnet add package Microsoft.VisualStudio.Web.CodeGeneration.Design
dotnet add package Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.Design
dotnet add package Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.SqlServer
